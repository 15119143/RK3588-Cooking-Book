# Chapter 3: RK3588 SBC GPIO

3.1 Using RK3588 GPIO pins

The RK3588 is a high-performance system-on-chip (SoC) designed for use in a wide range of applications, including embedded systems, IoT devices, and mobile devices. It features a number of General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins that can be used to control various peripheral devices.

Here are the general steps for using RK3588 GPIO pins:

First, you need to configure the GPIO pins you want to use as inputs or outputs. This can be done using the GPIO controller software, which is typically provided by the manufacturer.

Once the GPIO pins are configured, you can use them to control external devices. For example, you can set an output pin to a high or low voltage level to turn a connected LED on or off.

You can also read input pins to get information from external sensors or switches. For example, you can read the state of a button connected to an input pin to determine whether it is pressed or released.

In addition to basic input and output operations, many GPIO controllers also support more advanced features such as interrupts and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). These features can be used to implement more complex control schemes for peripheral devices.

It is important to note that the specific steps for using RK3588 GPIO pins may vary depending on the operating system, programming language, and development environment you are using. You should consult the manufacturer's documentation and any relevant programming guides or tutorials for more detailed instructions.
